Rerate is referred to as increasing the premium amount policy holders are paying for the policies.John Hancock providing same premium 
for year after year result into some depreciation. To overcome this economic crisis, the company decided to change the premium scheme. 
This change in premium is what we call Rerate.Before 2008, there was no concept of rerate. The policy holder had to pay what premium 
was decided at the time of purchase. After the inflation in the market, when John Hancock was going in losses, it decided to increase 
the premium amount over certain years to overcome these losses. In 2008, rerate was introduced and there was flat increase in percentage. For all the John Hancock
policies, the increase in percentage was 13% and for all the Fortis policies, the increase was 18%. After the success of 2008 rerate, 
rerate was done in 2010 and then in 2013, 2016, 2019 and 2022.

What if the rerate is denied by the policy holder?
Here introduced the concept of Landing Spot. Only the users who are having ABI Policies (Simple and Compound) are offered Landing Spot.
 Non-ABI policy holders, if deny rerate loses some benefits decided by the company.

PSC stands for Product State Combination.
PSCs are the combination of products and states which are provided to us in Anne Maki Sheet for those policies which needs rerate in 
particular anniversary month. When any new rerate and new requirements need to be added, they are provided by PSCs in Anne Maki Sheet. 
The PSCs for those policies which have been rerated in previous years and some rerate is still pending are also included.

Anne Maki Sheet - In this sheet, new PSCs are mentioned which needs rerate and these PSCs are added to the existing PSC's list.
Also the second year capped PSCs and other business requirements are mentioned in this sheet.

What is Landing Spot?
Term used to describe the benefit change which will allow eligible ABI policyholders to maintain their pre-rerate premium by reducing 
their inflation percentage. The Landing Spot percentage is determined by the actuaries and is only available to a policyholder during 
the rerate election period.ABI Policy holders are offered landing spot, which means they have the option of accepting or denying the 
rerate. What landing spot means is, if the policy holder denies the rerate, his offered benefits will be reduced. Suppose he accepts the
landing spot, then, if his benefits were supposed to be increased by 5% after accepting rerate, now his benefits will be increased 
by say 3% only.

Layered Landing Spot - Term used to describe instance where policyholder previously accepted a Landing Spot as part of the 2010/2013 
rate increase, then is offered a second Landing Spot for the 2013 rate increase. If policyholder is eligible for a 2016 Landing Spot, 
Landing Spot inflation percentage offered will vary depending on policyholder elections for prior rerate. Lower inflation percentages 
will be calculated for policyholders who previously accepted the 2010 Landing Spot; higher inflation percentages will be calculated for 
policyholders who previously accepted the rate increase.

Types of Policies: Basically, there are three types of policies offered:
1) Full Acceptance: Rerate is done once and for all and the same amount has to be paid by the policy holder every year. 
For example, the policy holder was paying a premium of $100 and after rerate, he was supposed to pay 20% more of the current premium. 
So after rerate, he will pay $120 every year.
2) Staggered: Rerate is done dividing the rerate percentage in different years and the rerate percentage for every year is provided in 
the very beginning when the rerate is done. For example, the policy holder was paying a premium of $100 and his premium is rerated by 
50%. Now, this increase in percentage is divided in years, which means in the first year after rerate, he will pay, say 20% more of 
the current premium, l.e. $120. In the second year, he will pay, say 20% more of the current premium, je, $140. And in the third year, 
he will pay, say 10% more, Le, $150. And thus the policy is called as 3-year-staggered- policy.
3) Capped: Term used for instances where a state which does not approve the rate increase fully as flled, 
capping the rate increase percentage which can be applied in a. given year. This is also referred to as an open ended or partial 
approval. It is same as staggered policy. The only difference is that the rerate percentage is provided yearly. Only the rerate 
percentage of first year is provided when the rerate is done. For example, the policy holder was paying a premium of $100 and his
 policy is rerated. Now, he was notified only about the increase in percentage for first year, say 30% and he will pay $130 in the 
 first year, then in the second year only he will be notified about the second premium, say 10% more of the current premium, l.e., 
 $140, and similarly in the third year, he will be notified the increase in percentage for third year, say 10%, l.e., $150.
4) Capped Staggered: It is combination of Capped and staggered. Every capped phase is staggered.

Some of the important Reference tables are listed below:
1) RR2010 REF PH MAILING (Includes the details of policy including PH Mailing Date)
2) RR2010_REF_PRODUCER_MAILING (Includes Producer mailing date)
3) RR2010 REF PRODUCTS (Includes product details like Product code & Product group)
4) RR2010 REF PRODUCTS_EXCEPTION (For any exceptional condition related to product)
5) RR2010_REF_LANDING_SPOT (Includes the details of landing spot, as Landing spot pct)

7) RR2010_REF_RERATE_FACTORS (Includes rerate factor and other details)
8) RR2010_REF_CNF_RERATE_FACTORS (For staggered policies to know the actual rerate)
9) RR2010_REF_CAP_STAG (To get whether the policy is cap stag or not)
Cap stag means the policy is staggered in every capped phase. Acronym used for instances where a state does not approve the rate
increase fully as filed, capping the rate increase percentage that can be applied and also requires that the approved percentage be 
implemented over multiple years similar to a staggered state. This is a hybrid of a traditional Capped and  Staggered approval.

RR2020_REF_PH_MAILING - This table includes all the basic information about the policies, including ISSUE_STATE, PRODUCT_CODE, 
PH_MAILING_DATE, ROUND, WAVE, ANNV_START_DATE, ANNV_STOP_DATE, PROCESSED FLG and RR YEAR.
PH_MAILING_DATE is the expected date on which the policy holder would be notified (4 months prior to the anniversary month) about the 
rerate.
ANNV START DATE is the first date of the anniversary month and ANNV_STOP_DATE is the last date of the anniversary month. 
Rerate is activated in the anniversary month only. If the policy is on claim on anniversary month of the rerate year, it will be 
rerated next year on the anniversary month only.
PROCESSED_FLG is the field which indicates the status of the processing of policies. It may be NULL, P, R, For D.
NULL represents those policies which needs to be processed at present.
P represents those policies which have been processed.

PODA stands for Personalized Option Decision Algorithm. PODA algorithm is the calculation and processing supporting reductions in 
Dally Maximum Benefit (DMB) and Benefit Period (BP), or a combination of the two, with the goal to get the policyholder as close to 
premium neutral (pre-rate Increase premium) as possible. PODA is offered to only those policies which are not offered landing spot and 
which are not permanently locked. But for terminated policies, it will run even if it is permanently locked.
PODA reduces the rerate modal premium nearly equal to current modal premium by reducing some benefits.
PODA 1: The daily monthly benefit is reduced.
PODA 2: The benefit period is reduced.
PODA 3: Both the daily monthly benefit as well as benefit period is reduced.

2022 Rate Increase Details:
In 2022, John Hancock completed another comprehensive claims study for long-term care insurance, which we generally conduct every three 
years, and which examines the usage trends for an insured population. Relative to previous expectations, the new data demonstrates 
lower mortality for non-claimants, higher utilization of benefits, and longer claims, partly offset by lower claim incidence.
Based on that data, we have determined that there is a need to increase premiums on certain policy series. Current scope includes 
policyholders in active and on waiver status for Retail and Fortis products which have gone through the rerate process atleast once 
in the prior rerates 2010 rerate, 2013 rerate, 2016 rerate and 2019 rerate. There are no JH products that are to be rerated for the 
first time with the Implementation of the 2022 rate increase.
The 2022RR Inflation Landing Spot will not be available to policyholders with the following inflation types as for 2019RR:
1) CPI COMPR (ADD GIO)?
2) CPI CMP75 (ADD GIO)?

For a policy on schedule without any rerate deferrals due to reasons including claim status, the NXT_POLICY_ANNIV_DATE of the eligible
rerate implementation with the offer buyout will always lie between the effective date and end date of the offer provided in the buyout 
ratesheet. For a policy which is a recovered claimant or whose rerate is deferred, the NXT_POLICY_ANNIV_DATE of the eligible rerate 
implementation with the offer buyout may or may not lie between the effective date and end date of the offer provided in the buyout 
ratesheet based on if revised buyout rates are received from actuaries.Post Monthly Extract generation (on 20th of every month) a 
list of the policies from the extract generated which are not 'On Claim' or 'SWOP' and have POLICY_BUY_OUT_ELIG set to 
'Eligible to Exercise' but POLICY_BUY_OUT_AMT set to blanks will be sent to actuarial team. Buyout ratesheets will be due on round 
locking, any updates to the existing ratesheets will also be due along with round locking with a communication from actuarial team 
mentioning the state product group and rerate implementations which have been updated for the policies that needed update.
