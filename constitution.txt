Rerate is referred to as increasing the premium amount policy holders are paying for the policies.John Hancock providing same premium 
for year after year result into some depreciation. To overcome this economic crisis, the company decided to change the premium scheme. 
This change in premium is what we call Rerate.Before 2008, there was no concept of rerate. The policy holder had to pay what premium 
was decided at the time of purchase. After the inflation in the market, when John Hancock was going in losses, it decided to increase 
the premium amount over certain years to overcome these losses. In 2008, rerate was introduced and there was flat increase in percentage. For all the John Hancock
policies, the increase in percentage was 13% and for all the Fortis policies, the increase was 18%. After the success of 2008 rerate, 
rerate was done in 2010 and then in 2013, 2016, 2019 and 2022.

What if the rerate is denied by the policyholder?
If the rerate is denied by the policyholder, then Landing Spot option is given to the policyholder. Only the users who are having ABI 
Policies (Simple and Compound) are offered Landing Spot.
Non-ABI policy holders, if deny rerate loses some benefits decided by the company.

PSC stands for Product State Combination.
PSC are the combination of products and states which are provided to us in Anne Maki Sheet for those policies which needs rerate in 
particular anniversary month. When any new rerate and new requirements need to be added, they are provided by PSC in Anne Maki Sheet. 
The PSC for those policies which have been rerated in previous years and some rerate is still pending are also included.

Anne Maki Sheet - In this sheet, new PSC are mentioned which needs rerate and these PSC are added to the existing PSC's list.
Also the second year capped PSC and other business requirements are mentioned in this sheet.

What is Landing Spot?
Landing Spot is a term used to describe the benefit change which will allow eligible ABI policyholders to maintain their pre-rerate premium by reducing 
their inflation percentage. The Landing Spot percentage is determined by the actuaries and is only available to a policyholder during 
the rerate election period. ABI Policy holders are offered landing spot, which means they have the option of accepting or denying the 
rerate. What landing spot means is, if the policy holder denies the rerate, his offered benefits will be reduced. Suppose he accepts the
landing spot, then, if his benefits were supposed to be increased by 5% after accepting rerate, now his benefits will be increased 
by say 3% only.
Landing Spot should be blank for Switch_65_Policies and DRA_BuyUp Policies.

Layered Landing Spot is a term used to describe instance where policyholder previously accepted a Landing Spot as part of the 2010/2013 
rate increase, then is offered a second Landing Spot for the 2013 rate increase. If policyholder is eligible for a 2016 Landing Spot, 
Landing Spot inflation percentage offered will vary depending on policyholder elections for prior rerate. Lower inflation percentages 
will be calculated for policyholders who previously accepted the 2010 Landing Spot; higher inflation percentages will be calculated for 
policyholders who previously accepted the rate increase.

Types of Policies: Basically, there are three types of policies offered:
1) Full Acceptance: Rerate is done once and for all and the same amount has to be paid by the policy holder every year. 
For example, the policy holder was paying a premium of $100 and after rerate, he was supposed to pay 20% more of the current premium. 
So after rerate, he will pay $120 every year.
2) Staggered: Rerate is done dividing the rerate percentage in different years and the rerate percentage for every year is provided in 
the very beginning when the rerate is done. For example, the policy holder was paying a premium of $100 and his premium is rerated by 
50%. Now, this increase in percentage is divided in years, which means in the first year after rerate, he will pay, say 20% more of 
the current premium, that is $120. In the second year, he will pay, say 20% more of the current premium, that is $140. And in the third year, 
he will pay, say 10% more, that is $150. And thus the policy is called as 3-year-staggered- policy.
3) Capped: Term used for instances where a state which does not approve the rate increase fully as flled, 
capping the rate increase percentage which can be applied in a given year. This is also referred to as an open ended or partial 
approval. It is same as staggered policy. The only difference is that the rerate percentage is provided yearly. Only the rerate 
percentage of first year is provided when the rerate is done. For example, the policy holder was paying a premium of $100 and his
policy is rerated. Now, he was notified only about the increase in percentage for first year, say 30% and he will pay $130 in the 
first year, then in the second year only he will be notified about the second premium, say 10% more of the current premium, that is
$140, and similarly in the third year, he will be notified the increase in percentage for third year, say 10%, that is $150.
4) Capped Staggered: It is combination of Capped and staggered. Every capped phase is staggered.

Some of the important Reference tables are listed below:
1) RR2010 REF PH MAILING - Includes the details of policy including PH Mailing Date
2) RR2010_REF_PRODUCER_MAILING - Includes Producer mailing date
3) RR2010 REF PRODUCTS - Includes product details like Product code & Product group
4) RR2010 REF PRODUCTS_EXCEPTION - For any exceptional condition related to product
5) RR2010_REF_LANDING_SPOT - Includes the details of landing spot, as Landing spot pct
6) RR2010_REF_LANDING_SPOT_EXCEPTION - Exceptional condition related to landing spot
7) RR2010_REF_RERATE_FACTORS - Includes rerate factor and other details
8) RR2010_REF_CNF_RERATE_FACTORS - For staggered policies to know the actual rerate
9) RR2010_REF_CAP_STAG - To get whether the policy is cap stag or not

Cap stag means the policy is staggered in every capped phase. Acronym used for instances where a state does not approve the rate
increase fully as filed, capping the rate increase percentage that can be applied and also requires that the approved percentage be 
implemented over multiple years similar to a staggered state. This is a hybrid of a traditional Capped and  Staggered approval.

RR2020_REF_PH_MAILING - This table includes all the basic information about the policies, including ISSUE_STATE, PRODUCT_CODE, 
PH_MAILING_DATE, ROUND, WAVE, ANNV_START_DATE, ANNV_STOP_DATE, PROCESSED FLG and RR YEAR.
PH_MAILING_DATE is the expected date on which the policy holder would be notified (4 months prior to the anniversary month) about the 
rerate.
ANNV START DATE is the first date of the anniversary month and ANNV_STOP_DATE is the last date of the anniversary month. 
Rerate is activated in the anniversary month only. If the policy is on claim on anniversary month of the rerate year, it will be 
rerated next year on the anniversary month only.
PROCESSED_FLG is the field which indicates the status of the processing of policies. It may be NULL, P, R, For D.
NULL represents those policies which needs to be processed at present.
'P' represents those policies which have been processed.
'R' represents those policies which have been processed & having the anniversary month.
'F' represents those policies which needs to be processed in future years.
'D' represents those policies which have no existence & are considered as deleted.

RR2010_REF_PRODUCER_MAILING - This table includes PRODUCER_MAILING_ID, PRODUCER MAILING DATE & DATA_AS_OF_DATE. PRODUCER_MAILING_DATE 
is the expected date when the rerate is notified to the producer and is 1 month prior to the PH_MAILING_DATE.

RR2010_REF_PRODUCTS - It includes the details of the product, like PRODUCT CODE, PRODUCT DESCRIPTION and PRODUCT_GROUP. PRODUCT_GROUP
defines which group does the product belongs to.

RR2010_REF_PRODUCTS_EXCEPTION - It includes the products which have some exceptional conditions related to product group. For example, 
issue state Wisconsin has same products for different scenarios. In such cases, REF_PRODUCT_EXCEPTION is maintained.

RR2010_REF_LANDING_SPOT - It includes the details of landing spot including Landing Spot Percentage with rerate decision.

RR2010_REF_LANDING_SPOT_EXCEPTION - It includes the products which have some exceptional conditions related to landing spot.

PODA stands for Personalized Option Decision Algorithm. PODA algorithm is the calculation and processing supporting reductions in 
Dally Maximum Benefit (DMB) and Benefit Period (BP), or a combination of the two, with the goal to get the policyholder as close to 
premium neutral (pre-rate Increase premium) as possible. PODA is offered to only those policies which are not offered landing spot and 
which are not permanently locked. But for terminated policies, it will run even if it is permanently locked.
PODA reduces the rerate modal premium nearly equal to current modal premium by reducing some benefits.
PODA options 1: The daily monthly benefit is reduced.
PODA options 2: The benefit period is reduced.
PODA options 3: Both the daily monthly benefit as well as benefit period is reduced.

The PODA options 1  is captured by below columns in Mailing Extract:
1) Rerate_Daily_Monthly_Bene
2) Rerate_Daily_Monthly_Bene_Prem
3) Rerate_HHC_DMB

The PODA options 2  is captured by below columns in Mailing Extract:
1) Rerate_RLMB_for_DMB
2) Rerate_RLMB_for_Combo

The PODA options 3 is captured by below columns in Mailing Extract:
1) Rerate_COMBO_DAILY_MONTHLY_BENE
2) Rerate_COMBO_BENE_PERIOD
3) Rerate_COMBO_DAILY_MONTHLY_BENE_PREM

All PODA options should be Blank if accumulated payments is > '$0'.

John Hancock introduced Shared Cost option in 2016 Rerate. Election of the Shared Cost Landing Spot will allow the policyholder’s 
premium to remain at the pre-rerate premium amount. PODA DMB and Shared Cost DMB reduction options cannot drop below the state 
mandated minimum benefit requirements. Pricing is calculating the Shared Cost factors using 2017 policyholder year end data.  
A default rate of “99” will be used for any benefit combination where pricing did not have data to calculate a Shared Cost percentage.   
No Shared Cost Landing Spot will be offered to a policyholder if the shared cost factor provided on the pricing rate sheet is “99” for
the policyholder’s current benefits. If a PODA DMB reduction option is not achieved for a policy, the Shared Cost Landing Spot will be 
calculated using the factor provided by pricing, unless the factor is “99”.  
The Shared Cost override field will be populated upon election for all policyholders to allow the user to view the Claim Mulitplier 
being applied to the policy. The policyholder’s Shared Cost factor will remain frozen upon election and should not be recalculated
in the event of a future benefit change with the exception of a future rerate Shared Cost Landing Spot election. 
Upon election of the Shared Cost Landing Spot, the policyholder’s DMB will be rounded to the nearest cent for all policyholders. 
Existing LifePRO DMB rounding rules will be used for policyholder’s who do not elect the Shared Cost Landing Spot.  
(Nearest dollar for retail and nearest cent for Fortis policyholders). 
The Shared Cost factor provided by pricing represents John Hancock’s portion.  For example, a factor of .881 represents an 11.9% 
Policyholder Shared Cost Percentage and an 88.1% JH Shared Cost Percentage.  
Future PODA DMB reduction options should be rounded to the nearest cent for all policyholders who previously elected the Shared Cost 
Landing Spot. For Dual pools having facility(NH) and non-facility(HHC) benefits, PODA options would be restricted to DMB reduction. 
For policies with CPI COMPOUND inflation, shared cost and PODA DMB reduction calculation has not been finalized. Shared cost landing 
spot option will not be offered for classic products. 
The columns that captures the Shared Cost Option in Mailing Extract tables are:
1) SHARED_COST_PRICING_FACTOR

2022 Rate Increase Details:
In 2022, John Hancock completed another comprehensive claims study for long-term care insurance, which we generally conduct every three 
years, and which examines the usage trends for an insured population. Relative to previous expectations, the new data demonstrates 
lower mortality for non-claimants, higher utilization of benefits, and longer claims, partly offset by lower claim incidence.
Based on that data, we have determined that there is a need to increase premiums on certain policy series. Current scope includes 
policyholders in active and on waiver status for Retail and Fortis products which have gone through the rerate process atleast once 
in the prior rerates 2010 rerate, 2013 rerate, 2016 rerate and 2019 rerate. There are no JH products that are to be rerated for the 
first time with the Implementation of the 2022 rate increase.
The 2022RR Inflation Landing Spot will not be available to policyholders with the following inflation types as for 2019RR:
1) CPI COMPR (ADD GIO)?
2) CPI CMP75 (ADD GIO)?
3) BEN BUILDER (BUY UP)?
4) AUTOMATIC CPI
5) CPI COMPOUND CORPSOL

2) Not on Claim – used for policyholder’s who do not meet the rerate on claim criteria on their rerate effective date and NH and HHC 
accumulated claims paid = 0.
3) Recovered – used for recovered claimants eligible for rerate - and whose NH or HHC accumulated claims paid is > 0 and the policy 
does not have the restoration of benefit either built in or as an optional rider.   (see attachments for products with ROB built in)
4) Recovered ROB – used for recovered claimants eligible for rerate and whose NH or HHC accumulated claims paid is > 0 and the policy 
includes the restoration of benefit either built in or as an optional rider.

4) N/A = partnership is not applicable.

Producer Mailing is populated with either 'Y' or 'N' or firm-type indicator. Producer letters should not be mailed to any 
JHFN or USAA producer. ARIC Private Label policies should also be excluded from the producer mailing. 
'USAA' shall be identified by Agency Code or Producer Number.
If Agency Code is equal to 325, Producer Mailing is populated with ‘USAA’
If  Producer Number is equal to 000003, 001001, 001002, 001003, 001004, 001005, 001006, 001007, 001008, 001009, 001010, 001227,

or the producer number not equal to any of the USAA producer numbers listed above, Producer Mailing is populated with ‘JHFN’.
ARIC Private Label policies shall be identified by Product Code.  If Product Code is equal to ARG96, ARF96, AWF96 OR AWJ96 Producer 
Mailing is populated with ‘N’ . 
If Producer Number equals ‘000001’, Producer Mailing is populated with ‘N’
If there isn’t an active agent in the hierarchy for a policy, Producer Mailing is populated with ‘N’
If agent is on the Blue Dot Restricted Agent List, Producer Mailing is populated with ‘N’
If the above conditions are not met then Producer Mailing is populated with ‘Y’.

Policyholder_Age_Nxt_Pol_Ann is the policyholder age as of the rerate effective date/next policy anniversary date.

Policyholder_DOB is the policyholders date of birth.

Capped is populated with either the percentage of the full filed increase, ‘Uncapped’ or ‘N/A’ based upon the filed and implemented 
rates sheets provided by actuary.
If the policyholder’s rate increase is capped, we determine the full rate increase percent based upon the filed rates considering the 
weighted average for GPO. Then Capped is populated with the total filed increase percent (i.e. 90.25%).  Formatted as a percent with 2 
decimals. If the value is a whole percent, suppress the two decimals.
If the state, product and inflation option includes capped rates, but the policyholder is not subject to a cap,  Capped is populated with 
‘Uncapped’.
If the state, product and inflation option does not have any capped values, Capped is populated with ‘N/A’. 
If Actuary does not provide a filed rate sheet containing the total filed rate increase percentages, it will be assumed no caps exists 
for this state, product and inflation option and Capped is populated with N/A.
If the policy is Cap_Stag and STAGGERED_YEAR >1 and the LETTER_TEMPLATE on the policyholder’s previous extract record on the EHT = 
‘2013’, Capped is populated with the CAPPED value from the policyholder’s previous extract record on the EHT.
For the New Hampshire rate increase implementation, if the policyholder is impacted by an attained age cap, the filed rate increase 
percentage should be derived using the rate sheet provided by actuary without applying the attained age cap factors.
If the policy is Cap_Stag and the Policy_Issue_State is not ‘Connecticut’ and Letter_Template is not ‘2016’ and the Filed rate increase
percentage is less than the Implemented rate increase percentage, Capped is populated with ‘Uncapped’
If the policy is Cap_Stag and the Policy Issue State = ‘Connecticut’ and Letter_Template = ‘2016’, Capped is populated with 
Filed rate increase percent even if the Filed rate increase percent is less than the Implemented rate increase percent.
If Policy Issue State = ‘Iowa’ or ‘New Jersey’ and Letter Template = ‘2016’ and the Filed rate increase percent does not equal the 
implemented rate increase percent, Capped is populated with the Filed rate increase percent even if the File rate is less 
than the implemented rate. The policy should be treated as a capped policy.
If Policy Issue State = ‘North Dakota’ and Product Code = ‘LTC2’ or ‘BSC2’ and Letter Template = ‘2016’ and Rerate_Inc_Pct exceeds the
Filed_Rate Inc_Pct, Capped is populated with Filed_Rate_Inc_Pct if the Implemented Staggered Year 3 rate factor is 1.2 on any benefit 
sequence else Capped is populated with ‘Uncapped’.
If the Policy_Issue_State = ‘Connecticut’ and Product_Code = ‘LTC3E’ or ‘L3PER’ and it’s a 2019 rerate supplemental implementation 
(Letter_Template = ‘2019’ and Round_wave like ‘R70%’) and the Filed rate increase percentage is less than the Implemented rate increase
percentage, Capped is populated with ‘Uncapped’.

Max_ReRate_Inc_Pct represents the maximum rate increase percent filed for the state/product combination based upon the actuarial rate 
sheets. This field will be used to validate the ReRate_Inc_Pct field.
For staggered states this value must be calculated by finding the maximum rate from each year’s rate sheet for the state/product 
combination and multiplying them together.  For example, first year max is 40%, second year max is 39.32%, the overall max is 
1.40x1.3932-1 = 95.04%.
For New Hampshire issued policies, ax_ReRate_Inc_Pct must be set to the policyholder’s attained age cap percentage. 

Filed_Rerate_Inc_Pct represents the filed rate increase percent and should be populated if the state/product/inflation option contains 
capped rates. If the policy is Cap_Stag and STAGGERED_YEAR>1 and the LETTER_TEMPLATE on the policyholder’s previous extract record on 
the EHT = ‘2013’, Filed_Rerate_Inc_Pct is populated with the FILED_RERATE_INC_PCT value from the policyholder’s previous extract record 
on the EHT. For the New Hampshire rate increase implementation, the filed rate increase percentage should be derived using the rate 
sheet provided by actuary without applying the attained age cap factors. 

Staggered Year represents the staggered year’s increase in effect. It should be populated with the applicable phase being implemented 
and not consecutive years.  Example:  If the full rate increase is being implemented in Year 1 then value = blank. If staggered in 
Year 1 then value = 1.  If Year 2 is final staggering then value = 2.  If the rate increase is being implemented every 3 years, 
Year 1 = 1, and the increase being implemented 3 years later should have a value of 2 not 4 
(the actual phase of the staggered implementation).
If the policyholder’s 2013 rate increase is staggered and the Stag_2010_Remaining field value = ‘N’ then reset the Staggered_Year 
value to ‘1’
If the policyholder’s 2013 rate increase is staggered and the Stag_2010_Remaining field value = ‘Y’ or ‘<blank>’ then set the 
Staggered_Year value to the next sequential number based on the policyholder’s previous rate increase record stored on the EHT.
Recovered Claimants should be handled in the same fashion.
If Policy_Issue_State = ‘Iowa’ and Letter_Template = ‘2013’ and the Remaining_% field value on the policyholder’s previous extract 
record is > 0% then set the Staggered_Year value to the next sequential number.

ECNFO policy limit is equal to the greater of 150% of Paid Premiums minus Claims Paid OR 30 times the Daily Benefit/1 times the 
Monthly Benefit. The ECNFO policy limit will be capped at the policies current RLMB amount. ECNFO policy limit should be set to blank 
if ECNFO_Elig does not equal 'Eligible to Exercise'.

LPCNFO_Elig is populated as 'Eligible to Exercise' if the policy's LPCNFO_Ratio is >=40% or if they are not eligible for ECNFO with a 
higher policy limit. 
LPCNFO_Elig is populated 'Not Eligible to Exercise' if the policy's LPCNFO_Ratio is <40% or if they are eligible for ECNFO with a 
higher policy limit. 
LPCNFO_Elig is populated 'N/A' if the LPCNFO Ratio is blank.

LPCNFO_DMB is a field which is the product of the policyholder's current DMB (Daily or Monthly) as of the next policy anniversary date (rerate effective 
date) and the LPCNFO Ratio. It is rounded to the nearest dollar.  In the situation where the inflation factor is not available to 
calculate the DMB as of rerate effective date, the policies current DMB will be used when calulating the LPCNFO DMB amount. i.e. 
CPI Compound inflation. LPCNFO_DMB should only be populated if the LPCNFO_Elig field is equal to 'Eligible to Exercise'.

LPCNFO_Policy_Limit is the product of the policyholder's current RLMB as of the next policy anniversary date (rerate effective date) 
and the LPCNFO Ratio. It is rounded to the nearest dollar. In the situation where the inflation factor is not available to calculate 
the DMB as of rerate effective date, the policies current DMB will be used when calulating the LPCNFO Policy Limit amount i.e. CPI 
Compound inflation. LPCNFO_Policy_Limit should only be populated if the LPCNFO_Elig field is equal to 'Eligible to Exercise'.
